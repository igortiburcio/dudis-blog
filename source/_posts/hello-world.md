Hello, welcome to my world!!

This is the first post I've ever written. For a long time, I've been thinking about having a blog to talk about my thoughts and things I'd like to share with others.
Sometimes all we need is to vent, and I've been feeling this urge getting stronger and stronger. Just to spend the words, without anything complex.
And what better time to expose it than in the first post of a blog.

## About the anxiety of speaking
I'm a programmer, I'm used to technology, and even before programming, I was already immersed in the internet for years.
My older brother is a programmer, he must be almost twice my age, by the way, I'm 27. This means I had a PC from a very young age.

When the internet became popular in Brazil, for me, it was already old news. What people feel today from the anxiety that the internet brings, I have already felt and overcome.
Overcoming this was wonderful for me. Today I see the internet as an incredible tool, but one that has little control over me. However, I feel like I've broken a cycle that no one else has broken yet.

This is part of the reason why I want to talk about things I like; I think people don't talk. They spend so much time on the internet worrying about irrelevant things that no one stops to talk anymore, and this has made me feel lonely.

Thinking about this brings a reflection: the greatest means of communication we have ever invented has made people less and less communicative. The human being is a social animal; talking and speaking are in our essence. It makes no sense that we have lost this gift at the moment we can talk to whoever we want, whenever we want, and regardless of where we are.

I remember when I started with the first mouse clicks, the year must have been 2006 or 2007, I was 7 or 8 years old, the internet was simpler. Social network? Just Orkut, a little bit of MSN. But it really shone in two places: forums and online games. I remember that talking on the internet at that time was easy. I remember entering Lineage 2 and walking through the cities, asking things, trying to understand what the others were saying, after all, I didn't speak English.

It was wonderful, there was no shame, there wasn't this outbreak of loneliness that the internet brings today. It was simple. You would find someone in the game and soon engage in a conversation, which turned into a hunt together, and the hunt turned into a story. I have great moments with people I've never met in my life, who weren't even from Brazil. They were people I couldn't communicate with, but with whom I could communicate.

The forums, on the other hand, were places of discussion, of ideas, of beliefs, of opinions. The first forum I got involved in was "Mundo RPG Maker", a forum for creating RPG Maker games. It was a sensational community; people developed, made stories, art, everything you can imagine a game needs, and they made it available there without asking for anything in return, just for the fact that they loved it. And then the comments came, praise, debates, discussions, and thus a community emerged. I made some friends on this forum, I started to want to be noticed by the community, I started with Design, there were posts teaching how to edit avatars and banners to put on the blog, I started to make my own, ask for opinions, evolve in Design, and people noticed me.

But it didn't last long. The reason I was in that community was that I wanted to make games, and what fascinated me was how users created features for the games that went beyond what RPG Maker XP (the most advanced at the time) could offer by default. They did this because RPG Maker had a script system, where you could program and add wonderful things to your games. Going from a simple turn-based RPG to a 2D action combat game like Zelda, or even a TCG card game. That's what I wanted to do, it was my first contact with programming, it was what made me want to learn to program.

Anyway, times and phases in which the world seemed simpler, more beautiful. I miss that time, I know it will never come back. Today the speed of the internet leads us to forget simple things, things that make us happy, things that make us feel human. Nobody has time to post on a forum anymore and wait hours for a response and from that response a friendship arises. If it's not for yesterday, it's no good. Poor people, they don't understand the beauty of that which is rambling and calm.
